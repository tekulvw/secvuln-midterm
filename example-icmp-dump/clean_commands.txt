# First, find which 'bucket' (log files are collected by timestamp on the hour)
# the ssh key data is in:
grep '@@@@@' *.txt

# Next, to piece together the ssh key data from the raw log txt dumps:
awk NF icmp-listener-<timestamp>.txt > cleaned-icmp-listener-<timestamp>.txt
grep -v '^Source Address' cleaned-icmp-listener-<timestamp>.txt > cleaned-dump-<timestamp>.txt

# Now you have the raw ssh key files!
